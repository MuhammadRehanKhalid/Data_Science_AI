    "Introduction\n",
    "Algebra often comes across as a challenging subject for many, but it’s a crucial stepping stone in understanding the language of mathematics. In this guide, we delve into the fundamentals of algebra through the lens of WH questions – What, Why, and How.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Algebra?\n",
    "Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulae and equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like a puzzle where we solve for the unknown values that make the equation true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term “algebra” is derived from the Arabic word “al-jabr,” which roughly translates to “reunion of broken parts.” This term comes from the title of the book “Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala” (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing) by the Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, written around 820 AD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebra founder Al Khawarzami\n",
    "The book was a groundbreaking work that dealt with solving linear and quadratic equations. The term “al-jabr” within the context of the book referred to the operation of moving a subtracted term to the other side of an equation, essentially “reuniting” it with the rest of the equation. For instance, turning x−5=7x−5=7 into x=7+5x=7+5 by adding 5 to both sides could be seen as an act of “al-jabr”.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Al-jabr” also implied a method of restoration or completion when terms were missing in an equation, filling in the gaps to balance and solve it. Over time, the Latin translations of al-Khwarizmi’s work introduced the term “algebra” into the European languages, which eventually became “algebra” in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept makes sense because much of algebra as we know it involves the manipulation of equations and expressions to find the values of unknown quantities, which can be thought of as “reuniting” the unknowns with their solutions or “completing” the broken parts of a mathematical problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Algebra Important?\n",
    "Problem-Solving: Algebra equips learners with the skills to solve a variety of real-world problems.\n",

    "How to Approach Algebra?\n",
    "Understanding the Basics: Grasp the fundamental operations and principles like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Our recent article on pre-algebra can help you to master the basics.\n",
    "Practice Regularly: Consistent practice is the key to mastering algebra. Engage in solving various algebraic equations to improve your skills.\n",
    "Seek Help When Stuck: Don’t hesitate to seek help from teachers, peers, or online resources whenever you hit a roadblock.\n",
    "Breaking it Down\n",
    "Algebra may seem daunting at first, but with the right approach and a curious mindset, it becomes a fascinating subject that opens up a world of possibilities. Remember, the journey of mastering algebra is a marathon, not a sprint. Equip yourself with patience, practice, and persistence to unravel the mysteries of algebra.\n",

    "History of Algebra\n",
    "The history of algebra is a rich and lengthy one, stretching back to ancient civilizations. Here’s a summarized timeline of its evolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ancient Origins (around 1900 BC)\n",
    "The roots of algebra can be traced back to ancient Egypt and Babylon. Babylonians are known to have used algebraic methods, as evidenced by stone tablets from around 1900 BC showcasing various mathematical computations1.\n",
    "Egyptian Algebra (1650 BC)\n",
    "In Egypt, a mathematical document dating back to 1650 BC was written by Ahmes, showcasing early algebraic thinking2.\n",
    "Greek Algebra:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Greeks took algebraic thinking further by developing geometric algebra.\n",
    "Islamic Golden Age (9th Century AD)\n",
    "The term “algebra” is derived from the Arabic word “al-jabr,” from a treatise written in 830 AD by the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi. His work, titled “Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala,” which translates to “The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing,” provided systematic solutions for linear and quadratic equations3.\n",
    "Medieval Period (3rd to 7th Century AD)\n",
    "Syncopated algebra first appeared during this period with Diophantus’ “Arithmetica” in the 3rd century AD, followed by Brahmagupta’s “Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta” in the 7th century4.\n",
    "Renaissance (13th to 17th Century AD)\n",
    "The shift towards symbolic algebra began with Islamic mathematicians such as Ibn al-Banna in the 13th-14th centuries and al-Qalasadi in the 15th century. Fully symbolic algebra was developed by François Viète in the 16th century, with René Descartes later introducing modern notation and showing that problems in geometry could be expressed and solved algebraically4.\n",
    "Modern Era\n",
    "Algebra continued to evolve and diversify into various branches like linear algebra, abstract algebra, and Boolean algebra, among others, forming the foundation for modern mathematics and computational science.\n",
    "This timeline underscores the collaborative and cumulative nature of algebra’s development, with contributions from various cultures and individuals over centuries. Each period built upon the previous, expanding the scope and application of algebraic thinking in solving increasingly complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like you can have a look in the table below to have an idea about history of algebra:\n",
    "\n",

    "Modern Era\tVarious Mathematicians\tEvolution and diversification into various branches of algebra like linear, abstract, and Boolean algebra.\tVarious modern algebraic branches\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, algebra is a vast and fundamental field of mathematics with its roots deeply embedded in history, tracing back to the ancient concept of “al-jabr” from the Arabic tradition. It’s fascinating to see how a term that originally referred to the method of solving equations by restoring missing parts has evolved into a comprehensive discipline that underpins much of modern mathematics and science. Today, algebra serves as the gateway to advanced mathematical study, and its application is evident across various fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and beyond. Whether it’s manipulating expressions, solving equations, or modeling complex systems, algebra remains an indispensable tool in both academic realms and everyday problem-solving scenarios. Understanding its key components and their practical uses not only honors the rich history of mathematics but also equips learners with the skills needed to navigate the logical structure of the world around them."
