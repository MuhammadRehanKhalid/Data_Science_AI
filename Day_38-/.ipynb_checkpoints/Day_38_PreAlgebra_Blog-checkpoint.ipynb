    "Numbers and Operations in algebra\n",
    "Natural Numbers: These are the numbers we naturally count with. They start from 1 and go on indefinitely (1, 2, 3, …). Example: The number of apples in a basket (assuming there’s at least one) is a natural number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whole Numbers: Whole numbers include all natural numbers and the number 0. Example: The number of cars in a parking lot, which could be zero or any natural number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers: Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. This includes numbers like -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, … Example: The temperature above or below zero on a thermometer is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rational Numbers: Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. They can be written as fractions. Example: The number 1/2 is rational because it represents one divided by two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrational Numbers: Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a simple fraction; their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating. Example: The square root of 2 (√2) is an irrational number because it cannot be precisely written as a fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real Numbers: Real numbers include all the rational and irrational numbers. The number line represents real numbers. Example: Pi (π), which is approximately 3.14159, is a real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic Operations: These are the basic operations we perform with numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition (+): Combining two amounts. Example: If you have 3 apples and get 2 more, you now have 3 + 2 = 5 apples.\n",
    "Subtraction (-): Finding the difference between amounts. Example: If you have 5 apples and eat 2, you have 5 – 2 = 3 apples left.\n",
    "Multiplication (×): Repeated addition of the same number. Example: If you have 4 bags with 3 apples each, you have 4 × 3 = 12 apples.\n",
    "Division (÷): Splitting into equal parts or groups. Example: If 12 apples are divided among 4 friends, each friend gets 12 ÷ 4 = 3 apples.\n",
    "Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): This rule helps us remember the sequence to solve operations in a complex expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parentheses/Brackets\n",
    "Exponents/Orders\n",
    "Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n",
    "Addition and Subtraction (from left to right) Example: For 3 + 4 × 2, multiply first (4 × 2 = 8), then add (3 + 8 = 11).\n",
    "Key Terms in Algebra\n",
    "Variable: A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that stands for a number that can vary or change. Example: In the expression x + 2, x is a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant: A constant is a fixed value that does not change. Example: In the expression x + 2, the number 2 is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficient: A coefficient is a number used to multiply a variable. Example: In 3x, 3 is the coefficient of the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression: An expression is a combination of variables, numbers, and operations. Example: 2x + 3y – 5 is an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation: An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal, indicated by the equal sign (=). Example: 2x + 3 = 11 is an equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inequality: An inequality is like an equation, but instead of equality, it shows a relationship of less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (≤), or greater than or equal to (≥). Example: x + 3 > 5 is an inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these basics is your first step in the journey into pre-algebra, providing the foundational language and concepts that will support your mathematical growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2: The World of Fractions and Decimals\n",
    "Steps to master algebra\n",
    "Simplifying Fractions\n",
    "To simplify a fraction, you divide the top and bottom by the highest number that divides into both exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Simplify 8/12. Both 8 and 12 can be divided by 4, so (8÷4)/(12÷4) = 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Denominator in algebra\n",
    "A common denominator is a shared multiple of the denominators of two or more fractions. It’s used to add or subtract fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: To add 1/4 and 3/5, find a common denominator, which is 20, so 1/4 = 5/20 and 3/5 = 12/20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding and Subtracting Fractions in algebra\n",
    "Fractions must have a common denominator to be added or subtracted. Then you add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: 5/20 + 12/20 = 17/20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying and Dividing Fractions in algebra\n",
    "To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and denominators separately. To divide, flip the second fraction and multiply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 simplifies to 1/2. For division, 2/3 ÷ 3/4 = 2/3 × 4/3 = 8/9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions in algebra\n",
    "A mixed number combines a whole number and a fraction, while an improper fraction has a numerator larger than its denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: 3½ is a mixed number. To convert it to an improper fraction: 3 × 2 + 1 = 7, so 3½ becomes 7/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decimals \n",
    "Converting Fractions to Decimals\n",
    "To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: 3/4 becomes 0.75 because 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding, Subtracting, Multiplying, and Dividing Decimals\n",
    "When adding or subtracting decimals, align the decimal points. For multiplication, multiply as with whole numbers, and count the total number of decimal places in both factors for the result. Division is done like whole numbers, but you may need to move the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75, and 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.10. For division, 0.75 ÷ 0.5 = 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rounding Decimals\n",
    "Rounding decimals involves shortening a decimal to a certain number of decimal places, based on the next digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Round 3.14159 to two decimal places: Since the third decimal is 1, round down to 3.14.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decimal Places and Significant Figures\n",
    "Decimal places count the numbers after the decimal point. Significant figures include all the meaningful digits in a number, not just after the decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In 123.45, there are two decimal places and five significant figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3: The Power of Ratios and Proportions in algebra\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Ratios\n",
    "Writing and Simplifying Ratios\n",
    "Ratios compare two quantities by division. When writing ratios, it’s important to keep the order consistent and simplify them as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The ratio of 8 oranges to 4 apples can be written as 8:4 and simplified to 2:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalent Ratios\n",
    "Equivalent ratios have the same value when simplified, even though they may look different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The ratios 2:1 and 4:2 are equivalent because when both are simplified, they result in the same ratio of 2:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proportions\n",
    "Setting up Proportions\n",
    "A proportion is an equation that states two ratios are equal. To set up a proportion, you need to have four related quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If 2 oranges cost $1, how much do 6 oranges cost? The proportion would be 2/1 = 6/x, where x is the cost of 6 oranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving Proportions\n",
    "To solve proportions, find the value of the variable that makes the two ratios equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: To solve 2/1 = 6/x, cross-multiply to get 2x = 6, then divide both sides by 2 to find x = 3. So, 6 oranges cost $3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct Variation\n",
    "Direct variation occurs when two quantities increase or decrease together at the same rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If y varies directly with x and y = 2 when x = 1, then the equation of direct variation is y = 2x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse Variation\n",
    "Inverse variation happens when one quantity increases while the other decreases. Their product is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If y varies inversely with x and y = 1 when x = 2, then the equation of inverse variation is xy = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4: Mastering the Art of Percentages in Algebra\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Percentages\n",
    "Converting Fractions and Decimals to Percentages\n",
    "Percentages are a way of expressing numbers as a fraction of 100. To convert a fraction or a decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100 and add the percent symbol (%) at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Convert 0.75 to a percentage: 0.75 × 100 = 75%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Convert 3/4 to a percentage: First convert 3/4 to a decimal which is 0.75, then multiply by 100 to get 75%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting Percentages to Fractions and Decimals\n",
    "To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide by 100. To convert a percentage to a fraction, write the percentage over 100 and simplify if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Convert 50% to a decimal: 50 ÷ 100 = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Convert 50% to a fraction: 50% = 50/100 = 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Percentages of Numbers\n",
    "To find a percentage of a number, convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply by the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Find 20% of 50: Convert 20% to a decimal (0.20) and multiply by 50 (0.20 × 50 = 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentage Increase and Decrease\n",
    "Percentage increase or decrease measures how much a number has gone up or down in percentage terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If a shirt was $50 and now is $65, the percentage increase is calculated as: [(65 – 50) ÷ 50] × 100 = 30% increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If a stock price drops from $30 to $25, the percentage decrease is: [(30 – 25) ÷ 30] × 100 = approximately 16.67% decrease.\n",
