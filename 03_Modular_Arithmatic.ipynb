    "### In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers \"wrap around\" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801.\n",
