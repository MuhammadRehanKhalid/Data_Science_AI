### Explanation of Each Directory/File:

- **data/**: This directory contains all data-related files.
  - **raw/**: Store raw data files that have not been processed.
  - **processed/**: Store processed data files that are ready for analysis.
  - **dummy_data/**: Store dummy datasets for testing and development purposes.

- **notebooks/**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and detailed analysis of ANOVA.

- **src/**: This is where the main source code for the ANOVA tool resides.
  - **__init__.py**: This file makes the `src` directory a package.
  - **anova.py**: Contains the main functions for performing ANOVA.
  - **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for data loading, preprocessing, etc.
  - **visualizations.py**: Contains functions for creating plots and visualizations of the results.
  - **statistics.py**: Contains statistical functions, including significance tests.

- **tests/**: This directory contains unit tests for the project.
  - **__init__.py**: This file makes the `tests` directory a package.
  - **test_anova.py**: Contains tests for the functions in `anova.py`.
  - **test_utils.py**: Contains tests for utility functions in `utils.py`.
  - **test_visualizations.py**: Contains tests for visualization functions.

- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the dependencies required for the project, which can be installed using `pip`.

- **setup.py**: A script for packaging the project, making it easy to install and distribute.

- **README.md**: A markdown file that provides an overview of the project, how to install it, how to use it, and any other relevant information.

- **.gitignore**: A file specifying which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage the project as it grows. You can modify it based on your specific needs and preferences.
